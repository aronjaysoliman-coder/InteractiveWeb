                <h3 class="topcont-txt">OVERVIEW</h3>
                    <p class="demo-prgph">My project focuses on teaching the life cycle of stars through a combination of clear lesson content and an interactive simulation. In the video, I explain my decision to use third-party hosting so the website can be easily accessed and viewed online. I then introduce my learning page, “Journey Through the Life Cycle of Stars,” which covers how key factors like mass, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and temperature influence a star’s color, size, and lifespan. I also present the dynamic laboratory page I built, where users can adjust sliders for different stellar properties and watch the star update in real time across various stages—from main sequence to red giant, neutron star, and even black hole. The project provides both conceptual understanding and hands-on exploration, making stellar evolution more engaging and easier to visualize.</p>

                    <h3 class="topcont-txt">SUMMARY</h3>
                        <p class="demo-prgph">In my video, I explain why I chose to use third-party hosting for my website, pointing out that it provides a simple and reliable way for others to view my project online without needing any special network setup or technical steps. I then introduce my learning page, “Journey Through the Life Cycle of Stars,” where I walk through the essential factors—such as mass, hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and temperature—that shape a star’s appearance, color, and lifespan. I also highlight the interactive laboratory page I created, which allows users to adjust variables using sliders and instantly see how the star’s size, color, and evolutionary stage change in real time. The canvas visually displays stages like the main sequence, red giant, neutron star, and black hole, while the right panel provides a clear status readout and estimated lifespan based on the selected inputs. Overall, I show how combining lesson content with dynamic simulation creates a more engaging and meaningful way to understand how different elements influence stellar evolution.</p>
